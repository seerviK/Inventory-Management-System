# üè• Medical Inventory Management System using Data Structures (Queue, Linked List)

Welcome to the **Medical Inventory Management System**, I have created this system suing core C language to implement the use of data structures like queue and linked list. Adding an element, deleting and updating is performed in the above project
## üåü Features

### Inventory Management
- **Add Items**: Add new items to the inventory with details like ID, name, quantity, and price.
- **Remove Items**: Remove items by name from the inventory with error handling for items not found.
- **Search for Items**: Quickly search for items by name and retrieve details such as ID, quantity, and price.
- **Update Items**: Update quantity and price for existing items in the inventory.
- **Display Inventory**: Display a detailed view of all items, including total price and individual item costs.

### Customer Cart Management

- **Remove from Cart**: Remove items from the cart and return them back to the inventory.
- **View Cart**: Display all items in the cart with a breakdown of costs.
- **Generate Bill**: Summarizes the total price of items in the cart, formatted in a customer-friendly bill.
